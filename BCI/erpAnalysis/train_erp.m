%   SamplingRate : sampling rate of the data, in Hz
%
%   EventLatencies : vector of sample offsets at which events occur
%
%   EventLabels : vector of true labels for each event (-1 = first class, +1 = second class)
%
%   EpochRange : time range relative to each event that shall be used for training
%                this is a 2-element vector with values in seconds [begin, end]
%
%   TimeRanges : time ranges in seconds relative to the epoch event
%                this is a [#ranges x 2] matrix with ranges in the rows
%                these ranges determine the time windows for which average features

%
%   Lambda : regularization parameter for shrinkage LDA (between 0 and 1)

%   Model : matlab struct that contains the model's parameters
%           (classifier weights, temporal filter)
